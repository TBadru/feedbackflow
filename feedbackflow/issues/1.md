# Add Multi-Select Feature for Content Feeds Page

Currently, on the content feeds page, users can select and analyze one thread at a time from sources like HackerNews, YouTube, or Reddit. It would be highly beneficial to introduce a feature that allows users to select multiple threads using checkboxes. After selecting multiple threads, users could click on an "Analyze" button, which would redirect them to the main page and pre-fill multiple URLs for analysis.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Add checkboxes next to each thread on the content feeds page.
2. Implement a feature to select multiple threads at once.
3. Introduce an "Analyze" button that:
   - Gathers the selected threads' URLs.
   - Redirects to the main page.
   - Pre-fills the CLI with the gathered URLs for analysis.

**Benefits:**
- Improves workflow efficiency by allowing bulk analysis.
- Enhances user experience by reducing repetitive actions.

**Additional Context:**
The current implementation supports analyzing one thread at a time, which can be time-consuming when multiple threads need to be analyzed.
